# Option 3: MountainVista

## Pro #1: 

<div use:addSteps={[{ steps: '1', classes: classP }]}>
Someday, you might have kids of your own, and you will look back at this time in your life, and you will say...

</div>

<div use:addSteps={[{ steps: '2', classes: classP }]}>

... when I was your age, I had to walk back and forth to school 2 miles in the snow, and it was 20 degrees below zero, and my parents refused to drive me...

</div>

<div use:addSteps={[{ steps: '3', classes: classP }]}>

... and you know what? I'm glad they did because it made me tougher, and at the end of the day this life is gonna kick your ass unless you get tougher. Just remember what my dad said: "When the earth quakes, and the poison arrows fall from the sky, and the pillars of Heaven shake. You just look that big olâ€™ storm right square in the eye and say, 'Give me your best shot, pal. I can take it.' "
